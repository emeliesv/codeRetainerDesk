## CODETEST RETAINER DESK
This is a codetest for Retainer Desk. 
I've used a React Starter template to easily get started with my app.

## THE PROBLEM
- Make an application with a free choose of code base
- Do a call to API
- List all employees in a list that looks good

I've choosen to approach the problem in the following way:
First I make a fetch to the API where I collect the data neccessary.
I then map over the data to render a list of the specific part of the data in a card-component.

The card-component is made by styled components and could be used again if wanted.
